Just wanted to make a quick post and annouce that I'll going to SCaLE (Southern California Linux Expo) this year, so if you happen to also be going, you might see me (though how you would do that when I haven't shown my face is beyond me)

If you want to know more about SCaLE and perhaps even want to go yourself, you can find more info at: <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x" target="_blank">http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/13x</a>
