<p>In case you've haven't noticed, the site should load a bit faster now. That's because I've moved away from using CMSs (sorry GetSimple. I love you...) and am now using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to generate my website as static html. This makes the site load faster (as it's just loading html instead of executing php functions) and is more secure; no control panel for hackers to try to break into and wreck stuff.</p>

<p>You can also help out the site now as it's now on <a href="https://github.com/Lomeli12/Lomeli12.net" target="_blank">Github</a>! I'll be updating any changes to the code every 1st of the month or whenever I make a new post, whichever comes first (99% of the time the former).</p>
