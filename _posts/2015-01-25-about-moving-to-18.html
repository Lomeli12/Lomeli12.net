<p>
Just wanted to get this out of the way since there's still a lot of drama revolving around 1.8.
</p><p>
I WILL be making mods for 1.8, but they'll probably be brand new mods (like <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/minecraft-mods/memory" target="_blank">Memory</a> or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/minecraft-mods/memory" target="_blank">Trophy Slots</a>). I'll probably eventually port my other mods to 1.8, but I rather experiment in 1.8 first rather than spend hours or days getting mods that work perfectly fine in 1.7 to work in 1.8 (plus there are a ton of mods that add 1.8 stuff to 1.7, so there really isn't any benefit to porting to 1.8 other than it'll make the port to 1.9 go smoother (unless they make 1.9 another drastically different update)).
