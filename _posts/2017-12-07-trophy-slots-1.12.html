<p>After an extremely long hiatus from modding, during which I've had two jobs (IT for a short while and now programming apps and robots for schools), 
gone to two seperate RTXs, went from never having visiting San Diego to traveling there nearly every week, I've finally had the change to update 
arguably my most well known and popular mods, Trophy Slots.</p>

<p>Not only is the mod now playable on Minecraft 1.12.2, but trading with Villagers for trophies, which was dropped in 1.8 due to the entire
trading system on Forge requiring a rewrite that kept being delayed, is now back. The mod now relies on the Advancement system that replaced the old
achievement system in 1.12, but otherwise works the same.</p>

<p>You can download it over on <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/trophy-slots/files/2507560" target="_blank">CurseForge</a>
