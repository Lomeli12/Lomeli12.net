So, a whole two months into the new year and I haven't put a PROPER update post on here yet. It's about time I fix that.
</p><p>
First thing's first, I will be attending <a href="http://rtxevent.com/" target="_blank">RTX 2016</a>. I had an amazing time last year and hope to have an equally amazing one this year. Looking forward to it.
</p><p>
Second, aside from the spring semester starting about midway last month, I've also started working as a Computer Science (though I've mostly been helping with Math) tutor for my school. As a result, I've had little time to work on mods, and what time I do have, I'm ususally too burnt out to work on stuff. I do try to mod every now and again, but I simply cannot sit down and work. While progress has slowed to almost a halt, you'll still probably see me push stuff every now and again on github. I'll make an update once more time as freed up.
</p><p>
And that should be everything you need to know. Thanks for reading, hope to get something out soon and maybe see some people at RTX.
