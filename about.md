In the mid-to-late 00s I first started my journey into programming in a middle school library with an outdated, even for the time, book on HTML. That book would eventually lead me to learning Visual Basic, then C#, and finally Java. I'm still constantly learning new concepts and occasionally new languages, never satisfied with what I already know. 

Around 2012, when I first started college and began focusing on Java, I jumped into the Minecraft: Java Edition modding scene. Not only did this help me better understand Java moreso than any course or educational video ever could, but through modding I've met and befriended programmers and artist I never would've interacted with otherwise. My mods currently have over 1.5 million downloads collectively, and I'm excited to see that number continue to climb.

I enjoy hiking, horror movies, traveling to new places, going to the gym, Coca Cola, and playing board games.
