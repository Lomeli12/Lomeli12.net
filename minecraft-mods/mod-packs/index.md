<p>I’ve been getting a few modpack and video requests recently. Rather than answer them all with the exact same response, here’s a picture of a duck:</p>

<p>Now some actual info on how I regard modpacks: As most of my mods are either licensed under the GPL or the LGPL, no written permission is required for any of my mods. More specifically, here is a list of <strong>what you Can and Can Not do</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You <strong>CAN </strong>redistribute my mods as you see fit, so long as you link back to this page or any of the Forum threads created by me.</li>
	<li>You <strong>CAN </strong>use my mods in a modpack, as long as you follow the terms set out by the GPL/LGPL and credit me.</li>
	<li>You <strong>CAN </strong>peak into the source code and modify things.</li>
	<li>You <strong>CAN </strong>distribute your modified version of any of my mods (known as derived work), but it must be licensed under the GPL/LGPL and credit me as well.</li>
	<li>You <strong>CAN NOT</strong> claim your builds are the official builds, cause that’s just rude.</li>
	<li>You <strong>CAN NOT</strong> sell my mods.</li>
	<li>You <strong>CAN NOT NOT</strong> have fun with my mods.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only exception to these rules is Elemental Creepers, which is a bit of a tricky situation. xSmallDeadGuyx basically vanished, so you can't really ask him for permissions, but I'm not 100% sure how to go about handling permissions for the mod, since I only got the okay to distribute my builds. Whether I can determine how my builds are distributed is the tough part, as I still consider it HIS mod. And since I don't like dealing with permissions as I feel that's just a waste of time for both ends, I'm kinda stuck on this. FOR NOW, just send me a PM telling me that you'll be using the mod. No need for a reply from me, as I'll maybe glance at it just to make note and that's about it. If issues with distribution come up, we'll cross that bridge when it comes.</p>

<p>In regards to videos, you are allowed to use my mod in any video without my permission. Please stop asking me for permission.</p>

<p>I like to thank everyone who enjoy my mods. It’s you guys who make it worth while to make mods.
