<p>Craft cards is a very simple mod that adds simple items called Craft Cards. By themselves, they aren't very special. However, when used on the handy Card Stamper, you can encode recipes onto them. Once a recipe is encoded, just have the right materials in your inventory and right click with the card in hand. It will instantly craft the item using the items in your inventory without the need of a work bench.</p>
