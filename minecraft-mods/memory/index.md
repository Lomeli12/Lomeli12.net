<p>Memory is a piss take on <em>Telltale Games's Minecraft: Story Mode</em>. Originally just an idea I thought would be funny to make after seeing a mockup on reddit, I made it a reality after a friend of mine bugged me for serveral weeks to make it. So here it is, long after it would be relevant to anyone, a mod that'll make blocks, mobs, and some entities say they will remember whatever acts of violence you committed against them, and nothing else.</p>
